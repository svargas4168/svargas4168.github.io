          <h3>What defines Web3?</h3>
          <p>Web 3.0, sometimes known as Web 3, is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a decentralized network and have access to their own data.</p>

              <h3>What is Web 3.0 and its examples?</h3>

        <p>We'll explain the advantages and disadvantages.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="DVPN-col">
            <h3>disvantages of a VPN over a DVPN(decentralized virtual private network).</h3>
            <p>The servers used by regular VPNs are controlled entirely by the VPN provider. Therefore, while your activity is hidden from your ISP and the sites you visit, your VPN can see everything, as all of the servers are centralized and owned and operated by a single entity.</p></div>
            <div class="DVPN-col"><h3>Advantages of a VPN over a DVPN
                </h3>
            <p>The Disadvantages of a DVPN
                The most obvious issue with dVPNs is latency. Since dVPNs connect you to private servers, the speed of your connection is going to be all over the place.</p></div>
